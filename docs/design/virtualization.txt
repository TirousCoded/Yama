 -- Virtualization --
 
 
	The Yama VM will be designed in part around the idea of always being
	explicit w/ the end-user as to what capabilities are and aren't being
	provided to code executing on the virtual machine.
	
	The Yama VM will be designed such that the end-user must explicitly
	state the capabilities they would like to give virtual machine code.
