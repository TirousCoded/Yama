## Using Notepad++ Themes

To import themes *Yama (Light)* and/or *Yama (Dark)* into *Notepad++*, go to `Language > User Defined Language > Define your language... > Import...`
then navigate to and select `Yama (Light).xml` and/or `Yama (Dark).xml`.

After importing, you can select them by going to `Language` and then selecting one.

For *Yama (Dark)* you should also go to `Settings > Style Configurator...` and then select a suitable *dark mode*
theme for the rest of *Notepad++*. I personally recommend `Vibrant Ink`. *Yama (Light)* is designed for the default
*light mode* theme.

Both *Yama (Light)* and *Yama (Dark)* are setup to automatically be selected for `.yama` files. If the wrong one is
selected by *Notepad++*, go to `Language > User Defined Language > Define your language...` select the one you **don't**
want automatically selected, and delete the text from its `Ext.:` field.
